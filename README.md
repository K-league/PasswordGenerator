## She Needed Stronger Passwords
Welcome y'all! Use this application to generate strong passwords. This password generator utilizes prompts to determine length, character type, with the option to include/ exclude numeric and special characters. When all prompts have been answered, a new password is generated!

## She Know the Highest Stakes - Password Security
Password security is vital for any strong, independently-minded individual... but who wants to bother with generating their own complex password? Moreover, developing a sufficiently complex password that doesn't repeat the form or content of a previously used password is time-consuming. Who wants to bother with that??

## She's Ready to Protect Her Logins
This password generator is the start of a series of revisited code for this developer. Upon completing her boot camp with the University of Texas, she looked at her code and saw opportunities abundant! Her background in communication was not well displayed in her codebase, so with grit, she undertook her previously (occasionally) completed assignments. Come along with her. She will show you how to run this code and thoroughly explain each application with proper documentation. It'll be fun! Put on your favorite Americana, alternative country music, and get ready to run some code!

## Getting Ready to Run
This code is meant to be run in the browser. No, install necessary! (Don't worry, that'll come in due time!) 
Begin by opening the index.html, then press Option + b. Or, right-click the file and select "Open in Default Browser."

## Tech Stack
This application demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript. Specifically: prompts, alerts, functions, for loops, concatenation, and arrays. As well as the use of HTML and CSS in conjunction with JavaScript! Whew! See the following resources to learn more.
